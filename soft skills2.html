           <h2>What are soft skills?</h2>
            <P class="p2">
                Soft skills are the skills you possess that go beyond your technical<br>, measurable abilities.
                 Soft skills focus more on your social, leadership, communication<br> and problem-solving skills,among others.
                  While hard skills are the training and knowledge<br> you've grown during your career,
                   soft skills are how you work with others and on your own. Although soft skills are more personality-based, 
                   you can still improve them.
            </P>

             <h3> Think fast: what are your best skills?</h3>
            <p class="p3">Most of us come up with something concrete – we’re great at ultimate
            frisbee, we can cook a fantastic apple pie, or we know our way around 
            a spreadsheet.<br>
            <br>
            Those are all excellent, but chances are, you’re overlooking an entire set of
            traits that are just as important.<br>
            <br> 
            If you haven’t heard of soft skills before, you’re in for a life-changing lesson
            They’re critical to getting a head start at work, and you can use them to
            improve your career prospects, job offers, or even to earn a bigger salary.<br>
            <br> 
            In this resource guide, you’ll learn the basics of soft skills, how they work,
            and how you can make them work for you.<br>

            <h4>How to improve your soft skills</h4>
            <P class="p4">
                There are many benefits to improving your soft skills, including relationship-building with colleagues
                 and career development. Here are 11 steps to improve your soft skills:
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
           <h5>Be open to feedback</h5>
            <P class="p5">
                A large part of improving your soft skills is being open to feedback you may receive from supervisors,
                 managers and even colleagues. When you're open to feedback, you can be better able to receive constructive 
                 criticism and use that information to improve in your workplace role, including your soft skills. 
                 You may receive feedback on your communication skills, ability to work in a group, time management,
                  leadership potential and more. As you're receiving feedback, consider thanking the individual who's providing 
                  it and developing a plan, either with yourself or through speaking with a manager, to improve and learn.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h6> Communicate often</h6>
            <P class="p6">
                Effective communication is a soft skill that benefits everyone in the workplace. 
                Although you may have tasks and responsibilities that don't require the help of anyone else in your office,
                 take the opportunities you have for forming relationships with those around you. Communicate often to develop this
                  soft skill. This includes communication face-to-face, through email and in presentations to a group. 
                  Since nearly every method of communication differs from another, it's important to communicate through various
                   means so your communication soft skills are more well-rounded.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
           <h6 class="h7"> Emphasize teamwork</h6>
            <P class="p7">
                When you engage in good teamwork, you show your employer that you're great at collaborating with others.
                 Teamwork could occur in a group setting for a presentation or one-on-one with another colleague to complete
                  a shared task. During a shared task or daily responsibility, allow each member of the group to contribute their 
                  share and celebrate the unique skills and personalities of the group. When you emphasize teamwork, 
                  you open yourself up to learning opportunities from your colleagues while improving your own skills.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
              <h6 class="h8"> Build positive relationships</h6>
            <P class="p8">
                A lot of the soft skills you use in the workplace rely on the relationship you have with other employees and managers.
                 You can build positive relationships with your colleagues by engaging in a genuine conversation about their weekend 
                 plans, family, hobbies and interests. Try to connect with them over a shared experience. If you work in a department
                  with multiple people, consider asking everyone if they want to go out for a group lunch on Friday.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Stepping away from the office is a nice way to connect with them on a personal level.
                   This may assist you professionally because you know their personality a bit more and understand how it
                    factors into their work ethic.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
           
            <h6 class="h9">Get outside of your comfort zone</h6>
            <P class="p9">
                As with anything you want to improve, it's important to step outside of your comfort zone and take on something new.
                This may be a new setting, new responsibilities or a leadership role. You can even offer to be the one in your group 
                who gives the project presentation as a way for you to improve your public speaking skills. Placing yourself in
                unfamiliar territory professionally has the potential to showcase to your manager how seriously you take your job 
                and allow you to learn something completely new.r colleagues while improving your own skills.
            </P>
            <br>
            <h6 class="h10"> Get ready to learn</h6>
            <P class="p10">
                As you go through your process of improving any soft skill, you may encounter setbacks, but you may encounte
                r many successes, too. What's important is that you learn from them. For example, if you're in charge of 
                a project and are working on your leadership and collaboration soft skills, consider taking time after the project
                 is complete (or even in phases during it) to gather feedback on your leadership and how the project could improve
                  next time. The people you work with are best able to evaluate how the project went and offer their feedback based
                   on prior experiences.
            </P>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <h6 class="h11"> Adapt to workplace changes</h6>
            <P class="p11">
                It's common for a workplace to go through fluctuations in anything from the office staff to workplace procedures, 
                and one way to improve your soft skills is to be adaptable. Adaptability is also an important soft skill to have
                 so you can come up with alternative solutions to any workplace issues that may arise. Be open to learning new
                  technologies when they're released and assist with training newcomers to the organization.
            </P>
